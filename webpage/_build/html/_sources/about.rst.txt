What is incomevis?
==================

Are you a policy-maker who wants to see the dynamics of national income inequality? 
Are you a researcher who wants to visualize economic growth puzzles such as convergence? 
Or are you simply a curious individual who wants to see your position in the national income distribution? 
Wonder no more because we present incomevis, a library for income visualization (and more)!

Comparing incomes is complicated. 
We offer three default deflators (consumer price index, household size, and regional price parities) to adjust nominal household income. 
The income adjustment process is automatically handled for you. You can further adjust our deflated incomes if you have additional variables that you want to incorporate. 
Also, if you like interactive visualization, our graph can be displayed using JavaScript's amChart library. 
If you prefer an animated visualization, we offer a dynamically controlled animation of our graph based on Python Matplotlib library.

**incomevis** is a visualization toolbox to graphically representing income distribution. 
It includes incomevis class and several helper functions.

Happy visualizing economic complexity!
