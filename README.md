Information about the distribution of income is communicated by numbers and statistics (e.g., the Gini coefficient). This can be difficult to understand and often requires specialized knowledge. Our goal is to provide a novel, eye-catching visual display of the income distribution in the United States that conveys fundamental information about the evolution and current level of income inequality. We use IPUMS CPS data to create household income deciles for each of the 51 states and DC from 1978 to 2018. Plotting these data gives a 3D chart that provides a startling picture of income differences within and across states.
